 * How to properly upload media files via the seed process.

 * Instead of directly passing ReadStream objects, which causes TypeScript errors,
 * a better approach is to:
 * 
 * 1. First create the media record in the Media collection
 * 2. Then manually copy the file to the correct public directory
 * 3. Update the media record with the correct filename
 * 
 * This avoids the TypeScript compatibility issues with ReadStreams and the Payload types.

/**
 * Usage instructions:
 * 
 * 1. Replace the direct file approach in uploadMediaFromFrontend with the above method
 * 2. Define the createMediaRecord function in seedMediaManagement.ts
 * 3. Copy files via copyFile instead of using streams
 * 4. Update the media records with filenames
 * 
 * This avoids TypeScript incompatibility while achieving the same result.
